## About the Project

**this project is inspired from a video made by [Link webDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j898RGRw0b4)**
but the code was written right after grasping the basics of the project **the code in this project is not a copy nor inspired by the code in the video** as i fully believe that speed running tutorials is not the answer to growth as a developer

### Process

Hello hope you're doing well . i started my planning by righting some pseudo code which i find to be helpful for writing clean code and making sure that my code is **SOLID** and after that i started by building the skeleton of the project AKA where the notes are going to be stored what technology to use for raw text to html conversion ext.

### Built with

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - js
    - react
    - react-showdown librery

### What I learned

i learned everything from common react programing patterns to react reconciliation and memoisation going through the struggle of building this project really forced me to learn deeper concepts about react and understand how it works under the hood

### Continued development

other features that might come will be:

- saving notes in local storage
- a landing page
- uploading the notes you take as a .md file
- better UI

### Useful resources

chapter 1 and 2 of [React re-renders guide: everything, all at once](https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-re-renders-guide) by **Nadia Makarevich** was a real inspiration and a key stone for my development in this project
